# Board-game-loan-system
This project seeks to help the user to manage the loans of table games that he makes to different clients. 

The app is capable of:
* Validate the information of a form
* Display the different loans that have been made
* Modify the information of the loans if there is any data capture error 
* Save the information in Local Storage so that when the page is reopened or refreshed it is displayed pre-existing information.    
* Only scroll down the loans section instead of the whole page
* Adjust the content to the screen size

> **Notes:**
> * The project is developed using Vite
>  *  It uses [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework for CSS.
>  * If the project is running on localhost, it can be activated using the console command `npm start` in addition to  `npm run dev`
> * The deployment of the web application was done with [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/)
